# Advanced Lane Detection


In this Repo, Deep Learning approach is going to be used instead of just Image Processing / video processing like [Self-Driving-Car-LaneDetection](https://github.com/shangeth/Self-Driving-Car-LaneDetection)

# Datasets
A opensourced car driving lane image datasets is used for training the model.

# Model
Ofcourse ConvNets, But implementing this paper on [Fully Convolutional Networks
for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211.pdf]).

The basic idea behind Fully ConvNets is all the layers are Convolution layers instead of Fully connected layer in the end.
